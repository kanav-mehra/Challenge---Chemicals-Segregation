### Binary Classification Challenge

A chemist has two chemical flasks labelled 1 and 0 which contains two different chemicals. He extracted 3 features from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them. You are provided with the results derived by the chemist and your task is to create a model that will label chemical 0 or 1 given its three features.

### Data Description

You are provided with two files test and train.

Train: This files consists of two csv files LogisticXtrain and LogisticYtrain. Xtrain consists of the features whereas Ytrain consists of the labels associated with the features.

Test: This file consists of two files LogisticXtest consisting of the features of test data and sample_output which represents in which format your solution csv must be submitted.
