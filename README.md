# Challenge---Chemicals-Segregation

### Binary Classification Challenge

This challenge is a part of the online Machine Learning course by Coding Blocks.
A chemist has two chemical flasks labelled 1 and 0 which contains two different chemicals. He extracted 3 features from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them. You are provided with the results derived by the chemist and your task is to create a model that will label chemical 0 or 1 given its three features.

### Data Description

You are provided with two files test and train.

Train: This files consists of two csv files Logistic_X_train and Logistic_Y_train. X_train consists of the features whereas Y_train consists of the labels associated with the features.

Test: This file consists of two files Logistic_X_test consisting of the features of test data and sample_output which represents in which format your solution csv must be submitted.

Note - Solution achieved 99% Accuracy on the challenge (solved using Logistic Regression)
